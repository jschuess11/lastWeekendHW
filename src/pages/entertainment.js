You can swim in North America’s largest recirculating pool, race down more than ¼ of a mile of water slides, and create mammoth splashes in Cannonball Cove. Looking to really get drenched? You can play with Typhoon Tower’s 70 interactive spray-stations or get soaked by the world’s largest erupting hydro storm as it releases 1,300 gallons of cascading water from a 33-foot tower! On the weekends, if you’re looking for a change of pace, you can play a round of mini golf or enjoy tranquil Lake Como on a Storybook Paddleboat on Lake Como.</p>
